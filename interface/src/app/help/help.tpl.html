    <h3><u>Expression compendium</u></h3>
    The webserver is currently using <i>P.a.</i> expression compendium. It was
    built on July 31 2015 and contains 125 datasets with 1051 individual
    samples. Each dataset is an experiment and all samples are collected in a
    non-redundant way into the compendium. If a sample is part of multiple
    experiments, it is only represented once in the compendium. It did not
    include any data sets uploaded after the build date. It was manually
    annotated by biologists into easily queried fields including strain,
    medium, genotype and more. By including all samples in a unified compendium
    (as opposed to separated by experiment) it allows for cross-experiment
    comparisons that reveal interesting trends that weren’t directly probed for
    in a previous controlled experiment.

  <div class="lead" id="Experiments">
    <h3><u>Experiments</u></h3>
    Experiments are obtained from the ArrayExpress database. Each experiment
    has a “E-XXXX-number” accession number defined by ArrayExpress. Each
    experiment consists of samples deposited together, designed and annotated
    as the authors chose. Experiments vary in the number of samples they
    contain. Samples may be from different conditions or replicates. The
    annotations that accompany each experiment can help interpret the samples
    and node activities within each experiment.

  <div class="lead" id="Samples">
    <h3><u>Samples</u></h3>
    We include samples measured on the Affymetrix Pseudomonas aeruginosa Array
    "Pae_G1a" (labeled as A-AFFY-30 in ArrayExpress database). Built from
    accessible data sets from the ArrayExpress database. Samples come
    from a variety of labs, conditions, genotypes, and growth phases.

  <div class="lead" id="Genes">
    <h3><u>Genes</u></h3>
    The ADAGE model is built with genes represented by probes on the Affymetrix
    microarray gene chip "Pae_G1a" and annotated as the <i>Pseudomonas
    aeruginosa</i> PAO1 reference strain. Genes are labeled with PA numbers or
    gene names, if available. Further annotations, PA14 homologs and information
    about gene function can be found at:
    <a href="http://pseudomonas.com">http://pseudomonas.com</a>
    <br>
    Information about the PAO1 genes used to build this server was obtained
    from the following NCBI website:
    <a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/gene/DATA/GENE_INFO/Archaea_Bacteria/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_PAO1.gene_info.gz"
    target="_blank">NCBI</a>.

  <div class="lead" id="Nodes">
    <h3><u>Nodes</u></h3>
    Nodes are building units in an ADAGE model. Each node is defined by a
    weight vector storing the weight value of each gene in that node. The
    number of nodes in the model (300) was predetermined using empirical
    evaluation of models built using a range of sizes [1]. On the
    other hand, the weights for each gene in each node were learned by the
    model in an unsupervised way. Each node is characterized by two signatures.

  <div class="lead" id="Signatures">
    <h3><u>Signatures</u></h3>
    Signatures are functional gene sets extracted by an ADAGE model. A
    signature contains genes contributing extremely positive high or negative
    high weights to a specific node. One node results in two signatures on
    positive and negative sides. The positive and negative signatures are
    treated independently. Signatures are trained to reconstruct the compendium
    of gene expression data and thus the genes in a signature are likely to
    have correlated expression values across the compendium. Such correlations
    can suggest mechanisms of Pseudomonas biology. For example, signatures
    typically contain co-operonic genes, which are examples of meaningful
    correlated expression. Further, genes that are annotated as functionally
    related using KEGG pathways or GO terms are often found grouped in
    signatures. However, many signatures contain genes whose interactions are
    yet undetermined, and these can help generate hypotheses.

  <div class="lead" id="High Weight Gene">
    <h3><u>High Weight Gene</u></h3>
    A high weight gene in a signature is a genes whose weight is more than 2.5
    standard deviations away from the mean weight of genes in that node.
    Because the weight vectors of nodes have different distributions, different
    nodes have different numbers of high weight genes. High weight genes are
    used to characterize a node because their expression levels have the
    largest influence on the activity of the node. A signature is composed of
    high weight genes on one side of a node.
